- can't use `$ dnf install mkdocs` - not very recent
- need to use pip install :-(
- TODO set up docker install

- move everything to ./docs (seems to be an absolute requirement!)
- `(cd .. && mkdocs new microbit-networking-book)`
- `mkdocs serve`


- wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/pxt-mkdocs-sample/master/docs/embed.js

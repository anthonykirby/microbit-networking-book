(work-in-progress for offline rendering)

simplest possible example for turning text into SVG (the code is "basic")
https://makecode.microbit.org/--docs?type=renderblocks&if=foo&code=basic&lang=en&render=1


"hello world" example
https://makecode.microbit.org/--docs?type=renderblocks&if=foo&code=basic.showString(%22Hello%20world%22)&lang=en&render=1

NB need to URL-encode the javascript

CURL incantation:
  curl -d "type=renderblocks&id=foo&lang=en&render=1&code=basic" -X GET "https://makecode.microbit.org/--docs"
  
... but still need it rendered by a browser to get the .svg

- could use phantomjs??
- could use google-chrome --headless etc

TODO how to extract SVG with all the styling?
